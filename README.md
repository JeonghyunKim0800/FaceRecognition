# FaceRecognition

Face Recognition Folder Security is a cybersecurity-focused project that leverages biometric authentication to protect sensitive data. As my third major project—following sports analytics work such as TennisML—this software demonstrates how machine learning and computer vision can enhance personal and enterprise security.


**Project Overview**
This tool restricts access to a local folder by verifying a user’s identity through real-time face recognition. Only the registered face is allowed to unlock the secured folder, providing a simple yet powerful biometric layer of protection.

**Key Features**

Cybersecurity Application: Built for real-world privacy and data protection use cases.

Biometric Authentication: Uses face_recognition and OpenCV to detect and verify users.

User Registration GUI: Register your face through a user-friendly interface.

EXE Conversion: Easily compiled into a standalone .exe for Windows deployment.

Offline Mode: Works without internet access, keeping data local and private.

**Technologies Used**

Python 3.10

OpenCV

face_recognition

Tkinter (for GUI)

pyinstaller (for .exe conversion)

** Use Cases**

Personal file protection

Prototype for enterprise-level secure login systems

Educational project to demonstrate biometric authentication in cybersecurity
